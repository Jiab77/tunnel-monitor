# Tunnel Monitor

Just a basic script that creates a tunnel with a given provider and relaunch it when its going down unexpectedly.

## Compatibility

This project has been made initially for being used with the [localtonet](https://localtonet.com) service but it has been adapted for working with the [loophole](https://loophole.cloud) service for performances reasons.

> I strongly recommend you to give a try to the [loophole](https://loophole.cloud) service as its the best free and open source alternative to __ngrok__ I've tested so far in terms of performances.
